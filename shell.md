# Shell

- Using a default value for a variable

  ```sh
  VAL=${<var>:-"<default>"}
  ```

  - The above sets default if var is null or unset. Use only `:` for skipping null check.

- Reuse previous shell command

  ```sh
  $ !!
  ```

  Example: check git root and cd if proper

  ```sh
  $ git rev-parse --show-toplevel
  /git/root
  $ cd $(!!)
  ```

- Reinstall xcode-select @MACOS

  ```sh
  $ sudo rm -rf $(xcode-select --print-path) && xcode-select --install
  ```

- Mount external ntfs hdd @MACOS

  1. `brew cask install osxfuse`
  2. Reboot
  3. `brew install ntfs-3g`
  4. Connect hdd
  5. `mkdir ~/NTFS`
  6. `diskutil list` (check MS drive num eg disk2s1)
  7. `sudo umount /dev/disk2s1`
  8. `sudo /usr/local/bin/ntfs-3g /dev/disk2s1 ~/NTFS -olocal -oallow_other`

- Mount an attached block storage (pre-formatted) to instance using fstab

  - Check currently attached volumes `lsblk` (ensure attached but not mounted)

  - Get UUID of volume `blkid`

  - Add entry in /etc/fstab `UUID=<from above> /mount/point format options`

  - Mount all fstab volumes `sudo mount -a`

  - Check currently attached volumes `lsblk` (ensure mounted)

  - <span style="color:orange">IMPORTANT!</span> If attaching new block storage, may need to format first

- Check size of a directory

  ```sh
  $ du -sh <dir>
  ```

  where,

  - s = summary
  - h = human readable format

  Example: Get size of all directories in current directory

  ```sh
  $ du -sh ./*/
  ```

- Move new files only (do not overwrite if exists)

  ```sh
  $ mv -vn <source> <target>
  ```

  where,

  - v = verbose
  - n = no overwrite

- if/else

  ```sh
  $ if [ <test> ]; then <something>; fi
  ```

  for command sucess | fail, simply do this (no sq brackets)

  ```sh
  $ if command; then <sucess>; else <fail>; fi
  ```

  - Check if an environment variable exists

    ```bash
    if [[ -z $ENV_VAR ]]; then echo "Not exists"; fi;
    ```

- for loop

  ```sh
  for ((expr1;expr2;expr3)); do <command>; done;
  ```

  Example: Loop from 1 to END

  ```sh
  END=5
  for ((i=1;i<=END;i++)); do echo $i; done;
  ```

- for in loop

  ```sh
  for <variable> in <list>; do <command>; done
  ```

  Example: Add all dot files to gitignore

  ```sh
  for file in .*; do echo $file >> .gitignore; done
  ```

- Arrays

  An array in shell is within `()` brackets and looped like so:

  ```sh
  arr=("a" "b" "c")

  for alph in ${arr[*]}; do echo $alph; done;
  ```

  Note that on cli, direct `$arr` works for looping but not in script!

- Script strict mode

  _Ignore the \ in \# below, kept for formatting reasons_

  ```sh
  \#!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -euo pipefail
  IFS=$'\n\t'
  ```

  [http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/)

- Find command

  ```sh
  find <path> [-type | -size] -name "regex" [-exec <another cmd> | -delete]
  ```

  Example: find and delete all dot files in current directory

  ```sh
  find . -name ".*" -delete
  ```

  as an alternative, `fd` works as follows

  ```sh
  fd -t [d|f] [-HIL] "regex"
  ```

- Remove duplicate lines from a file

  ```sh
  awk '!l[$0]++' file > newfile
  ```

  if order is not important

  ```sh
  sort -u file > newfile
  ```

- Start a background job

  ```sh
  nohup <job> < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
  ```

  where,

  - nohup = no hangup signal
  - \< /dev/null = no stdin (input)
  - \> /dev/null = no nohup file (output)
  - 2>&1 = redirect errors to stdout (which is null)
  - & = start in background
  - disown = detach from shell

  Example: To start [mpv](https://mpv.io/) as music daemon

  ```sh
  nohup mpv --no-audio-display --shuffle ~/Music < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
  ```

- Mount Ram as disk

  ```sh
  sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=5g tmpfs /mnt/ramfs
  ```

  where a new temporary mount point /mnt/ramfs is created with 5 Gigabytes of capacity;
  to unmount, do

  ```sh
  umount /mnt/ramfs
  ```

- Watch a file for change and run command when changes

  ```sh
  while true; do watch -g ls -l <filename> && <cmd>; sleep 5; done
  ```

- Download a webpage and all it's linked pages and content

  ```sh
  wget -r -l 1 -p -k -H -D domain.com,relateddomain.com http://domain.com/page/in/domain
  ```

  where,

  - r = recurse
  - k = patch local links
  - H = traverse domains other than original
  - D = limit domains traversed
  - l = depth of recursion
  - p = download related content like images

- Generate a random base64 string (May be used as token or password)

  ```sh
  head -n1 /dev/urandom | base64
  ```

  - number after `n` changes length of string

- Lazy regex quatifier (works in js, not is sed, vim)

  Suppose there is a line like so:

  `"this is some string" "this is another string"`

  And the aims is to select everything within quotes as a string.

  A naive regex would be: `/".*"/`

  But it actually selects everything inside starting from first " to the end of line "

  To select only the content withing first closing quote, do : `/.*?/`

  That is, add a `?` aka a lazy quatifier (as opposed to normal greedy approach)

- Add colour to console output (make sure to add _Reset_ at the end after adding colour)

  `\033[0m` : Reset
  `\033[1m` : Bold
  `\033[91m` : Red
  `\033[92m` : Green
  `\033[93m` : Blue

  - JS Function

  ```js
  const colorize = (...args) => ({
    black: `\x1b[30m${args.join(" ")}`,
    red: `\x1b[31m${args.join(" ")}`,
    green: `\x1b[32m${args.join(" ")}`,
    yellow: `\x1b[33m${args.join(" ")}`,
    blue: `\x1b[34m${args.join(" ")}`,
    magenta: `\x1b[35m${args.join(" ")}`,
    cyan: `\x1b[36m${args.join(" ")}`,
    white: `\x1b[37m${args.join(" ")}`,
    bgBlack: `\x1b[40m${args.join(" ")}\x1b[0m`,
    bgRed: `\x1b[41m${args.join(" ")}\x1b[0m`,
    bgGreen: `\x1b[42m${args.join(" ")}\x1b[0m`,
    bgYellow: `\x1b[43m${args.join(" ")}\x1b[0m`,
    bgBlue: `\x1b[44m${args.join(" ")}\x1b[0m`,
    bgMagenta: `\x1b[45m${args.join(" ")}\x1b[0m`,
    bgCyan: `\x1b[46m${args.join(" ")}\x1b[0m`,
    bgWhite: `\x1b[47m${args.join(" ")}\x1b[0m`,
  });
  ```

- Process SIGnals (`man signal`)

  - The INT (interrupt) signal is the weakest. It is the signal number 2. Its meaning is "stop what you're doing right now and wait for further user input". It's the signal generated by Ctrl+C in a terminal

  - The TERM (terminate) signal is the normal kill signal (i.e. the one sent when you just call kill). It is signal number 15. It tells the application to exit cleanly. This signal allows for a trap handler, which enables the receiving process to do some clean up in an orderly fashion. An application that doesn't want to be interrupted during a critical operation might ignore SIGTERM for a while.

  - The HUP signal (hang up) is about the same as SIGTERM in terms of harshness, but it has a specific role because it's automatically sent to applications running in a terminal when the user disconnects from that terminal. It is signal number 1.

  - The QUIT signal is the harshest of the ignorable signals. It's meant to be used when an application is misbehaving and needs to be killed now, and by default it traditionally left a core dump file. It is signal number 3.

  - The KILL signal does not have ANY possibility of the being resisted. It always works because a KILL signal cannot be handled. This is both its blessing and its curse. It is signal number 9.

## curl

- Send an email using gmail smtp

  ```sh
  curl --ssl-reqd \
    --url smtp://smtp.gmail.com \
    --mail-from sender@gmail.com \
    --mail-rcpt recipient@mail.com \
    --user "sender@gmail.com:apppassword" \
    --upload-file mail.txt
  ```

  where mail.txt:

  ```txt
  From: Sender Name <sender@gmail.com>
  To: Recipient Name <recipient@mail.com>
  Subject: an example.com example email
  Date: Mon, 5 Nov 1994 12:10:00

  Dear Recipient,
  This is an example email.
  ```

## vlc [cli mode]

- Start vlc with ncurses interface

  ```sh
  vlc --intf ncurses --random --loop --audio --recursive --no-video ~/Music/
  ```

  - `recursive` is so subdirs in playlist expand instead of just sitting there; gui is preferences > all > playlist > subdir behav > expand

## youtube-dl

- Download songs from youtube

  [https://youtube-dl.org/](https://youtube-dl.org/)

  Only audio:

  ```sh
  youtube-dl --ignore-errors --format bestaudio --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 --output '%(title)s.%(ext)s' [--yes-playlist] <"URL" | --batch-file  ./fileName>
  ```

  _where fileName is a list of urls separated by blank lines;_

  Best video+audio:

  ```sh
  youtube-dl --ignore-errors --format 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/bestvideo+bestaudio' --merge-output-format mp4  -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' <"video-link">
  ```

  Note the brackets for the above are part of the command.

## gpg

- Encrypt file for self

  ```sh
  gpg --encrypt ["name" | --recipient <self@mail.com>] <file>
  ```

  This will create an encryped `<file>.gpg` file in same directory. Opening it normally will show gibberish.

- Decrypt a file

  ```sh
  gpg --decrypt <file>.gpg
  ```

  This will ask for your gpg passphrase and output the original `<file>`.

- Export public key to server (so can encrypt files there)

  ```sh
  gpg --armor --export <self@mail.com> > pub.key
  ```

  - Copy `pub.key` to server (via scp or copy-paste), then

  ```sh
  gpg --import pub.key
  ```

## beets

- Seek help

  ```shell
  $ beet help [command]
  ```

- For all tracks in albumFolder, import metadata, fix filenames and copy to Dir:

  ```shell
  $ beet -d ~/Dir import [-S <url>] [-s <file> | -g <folder>]
  ```

  where  
  \-S - Source URL (musicbrainz)
  \-s - Import as single track (Artist -> Track)
  \-g - Import as album (Album -> Track)
