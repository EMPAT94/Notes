# rclone

- [Official Site](https://rclone.org/)

> Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage.

- I followed the steps for [Storj](https://storj.com) [here](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/how-tos/sync-files-with-rclone/rclone-with-hosted-gateway/)

- To add/edit a cloud provider

  ```sh
  rclone config
  ```

  and follow the prompts

## Bucket commands

- Create a bucket

  ```sh
  rclone mkdir <provider>:<new-bucker-name>
  ```

- List all buckets

  ```sh
  rclone lsf <provider>:
  ```

- Delete an empty bucket

  ```sh
  rclone rmdir <provider>:<bucket-name>
  ```

- Delete non-empty bucket

  ```sh
  rclone purge <provider>:<bucket-name>
  ```

## Object commands

- Copy an object from SRC to DST

  ```sh
  rclone copy [--progress] SRC DST
  ```

  - SRC/DST can be local/remote.

- List objects

  ```sh
  rclone ls <provider>:<bucker>/path
  ```

  - use `lsf` for non-recursive

- Delete an object

  ```sh
  rclone delete[file] <provider>:<bucket>/path
  ```

- Sync SRC and DST

  > Use the sync command to sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only. Doesnâ€™t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if necessary.

  ```sh
  rclone sync [--progress] SRC DST
  ```

## Password inside shell script

```env
RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS=whateverthepasswordis
```

```sh
export $(cat /home/ubuntu/nextcloud/.env | xargs -0)
# ... rclone commands
unset RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
```
