# rclone

* [Official Site](https://rclone.org/)

> Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage.

* I followed the steps for [Storj](https://storj.com) [here](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/how-tos/sync-files-with-rclone/rclone-with-hosted-gateway/)
* To add/edit a cloud provider

  ```
  rclone config
  
  ```

  and follow the prompts

## Bucket commands

* Create a bucket

  ```
  rclone mkdir <provider>:<new-bucker-name>
  
  ```
* List all buckets

  ```
  rclone lsf <provider>:
  
  ```
* Delete an empty bucket

  ```
  rclone rmdir <provider>:<bucket-name>
  
  ```
* Delete non-empty bucket

  ```
  rclone purge <provider>:<bucket-name>
  
  ```

## Object commands

* Copy an object from SRC to DST

  ```
  rclone copy [--progress] SRC DST
  
  ```
  * SRC/DST can be local/remote.
* List objects

  ```
  rclone ls <provider>:<bucker>/path
  
  ```
  * use lsf for non-recursive
* Delete an object

  ```
  rclone delete[file] <provider>:<bucket>/path
  
  ```
* Sync SRC and DST

  > Use the sync command to sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only. Doesnâ€™t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if necessary.

  ```
  rclone sync [--progress] SRC DST
  
  ```
