## RDBMS Notes

### Terminology

- Tables - Collection of entities

- Columns - Single Attribute

- Rows - Single Entity (Record)

### Normalization

- 1st Form

  - Must have a Primary key
  - No repetition of column data
  - No multivalue attributes

- 2st Form

  - No repetition of row data
  - All keys in a table depend on primary key
  - Each table is one logical unit

- 3rd Form

  - No dependencies in between columns of same table
  - No derived values stored

- Goes all the way till 6th Normal Form (theoretically)

### Denormalization

### Multiplicity (Foreign Relations)

- One to One

- One to Many

  - Key stored in "Many" table

- Many to Many

  - Requires extra table to hold relations (junction table)

### JOINS

Assume tables A and B with some primary-foreign key relationship.

- A Inner Join B: Only records in A and B that match (intersection)

- A Left Join B: All records in A + matching records in B (A + intersection)

- A Right Join B: All records in B + matching records in A (B + intersection)

- A Outer Join B: All records in A + All records in B (union)

- A Cross Join B (Cartesian Product): All records in A x All records in B

### Transaction

> a logical unit of work against a database which may spread across one or more operations.

- Follow ACID properties:

  - Atomicity: (operations) succeed or fail completely (no partials)

  - Consistency: data is always in valid state before and after transaction (constraints are checked)

  - Isolation: One transaction does not affect another transaction

  - Durability: Results of a transaction are permanent

- Explicit Transaction Control:

  - BEGIN [TRANSACTION] - Start a transaction, operations follow this keyword
  - COMMIT [TRANSACTION] - Define a transaction success; data is saved in database
  - ROLLBACK [TRANSACTION] - Define a transaction failure; database is reverted to previous valid state
